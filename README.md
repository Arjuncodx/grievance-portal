# District Collector Dashboard — Citizen Module

A Next.js (App Router + TypeScript) application for the Greater Chennai
Corporation's Public Grievance Redressal Portal. This delivery covers
**authentication, user profiles, and the full citizen module** (file a
complaint + track status). The codebase is structured so a Collector
dashboard (`/collector`) and a Department Officer dashboard (`/officer`)
can be built on top without refactoring anything here — placeholder pages
for both already exist and are role-protected.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript
- MySQL via `mysql2` (parameterized queries only, no ORM)
- Tailwind CSS
- `bcryptjs` for password hashing, `jose` for JWT (httpOnly cookies), Next.js middleware for role-based route protection
- `nodemailer` for OTP emails
- `zod` for client + server validation
- OpenAI API for "Others" complaint classification (server-side only), with a keyword-based fallback classifier
- Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap for the complaint-location map (no API key needed)

## 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.18+ (Node 20 LTS recommended)
- MySQL 8.x running locally or reachable over the network
- (Optional) an SMTP account for real OTP emails — Gmail App Passwords work well for testing
- (Optional) an OpenAI API key for AI-based complaint classification

## 2. Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Create the database and load the schema (creates the DB, all tables, and seed data)
mysql -u root -p < schema.sql

# 3. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env with your DB credentials and JWT secret.
# SMTP is only needed for password reset and mobile OTP emails.

# 4. Apply migrations (idempotent; safe to re-run)
node scripts/migrate.js

# 5. Import + load the verified GCC reference data (see section 8)
node scripts/import-gcc-reference.js --streets
node scripts/import-ward-boundaries.js
node scripts/seed-gcc-reference.js

# 6. (Optional) Seed 3 sample accounts — one per role, password: Passw0rd!
node scripts/seed-users.js

# 7. Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

`node scripts/migrate.js --status` lists applied and pending migrations;
`--dry-run` prints the SQL without executing it. Migrations are additive — none
of them drops a column or table holding complaint data.

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000. Visiting `/` redirects
to `/login` if you're not signed in, or to your role's home page if you are.

### Sample accounts (after running `scripts/seed-users.js`)

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Collector | collector@chennai.gov.in | Passw0rd! |
| Department Officer (Electrical) | officer.electrical@chennai.gov.in | Passw0rd! |
| Citizen | citizen@example.com | Passw0rd! |

You can also just register fresh accounts via `/register`.

### Dev-mode OTPs

With `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_SHOW_OTP=true` **and** `NODE_ENV` set to something
other than `production`, OTP-sending endpoints also return the plaintext code
in the API response — handy for testing without a mail gateway.

Both conditions are required. Every route that can echo a code goes through
`devOtpForResponse()` in `src/lib/otp.ts`, which returns `undefined` whenever
`NODE_ENV === "production"`, so leaving the flag set to `true` by mistake in a
production deployment still cannot leak a code through an API response or the
UI.

```

## 4. Database

`schema.sql` creates:

- `zones`, `localities`, `streets` — the 15 GCC zones with real ward ranges, localities per zone, and generic placeholder streets per locality (documented in the file as needing a real GIS street master eventually)
- `departments` — exactly the 16 GCC departments
- `complaint_types` — the seeded complaint types, each mapped to a department, including "Others"
- `users`, `user_profiles`, `password_resets` (also used for the mobile-OTP and complaint-OTP flows), `complaints`, `complaint_status_history`

Complaint creation and its first status-history row are written inside a
single DB transaction (`withTransaction` in `src/lib/db.ts`).

## 5. Security Notes

- Every API route re-checks the session from the httpOnly JWT cookie server-side; a citizen can only ever read/write their own complaints and profile (enforced by `WHERE user_id = ?` / ownership checks, never by trusting client-supplied IDs).
- All SQL uses parameterized queries via `mysql2`.
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 10); OTPs are hashed the same way before storage and expire after 10 minutes with a 5-attempt cap and 60-second resend cooldown.
- JWTs are signed with `jose` (HS256) and stored in an httpOnly, sameSite=lax cookie (secure in production).
- Aadhaar numbers are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest and only ever displayed masked (`XXXX-XXXX-1234`).
- Login/register/forgot-password endpoints are rate-limited per IP and per email (in-memory — swap for Redis if you run multiple server instances).

## 6. API Endpoints

All endpoints are under `/api`. Authenticated endpoints read the session
from the `dcd_session` httpOnly cookie — no bearer tokens needed from the
client.

### Auth

| Method | Endpoint | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | `{ email, password, confirmPassword, role, departmentId? }` | `departmentId` required only when `role = "department_officer"` |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | `{ email, password }` | Sets the session cookie; response includes `redirectTo` based on role |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | — | Clears the session cookie |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | — | Returns the logged-in user's basic info |
| POST | `/api/auth/forgot-password/request-otp` | `{ email }` | Always returns a generic message (doesn't reveal if the email exists) |
| POST | `/api/auth/forgot-password/verify-otp` | `{ email, otp }` | |
| POST | `/api/auth/forgot-password/reset-password` | `{ email, otp, newPassword, confirmPassword }` | |

**Example — login**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"citizen@example.com","password":"Passw0rd!"}'
```
```json
{ "message": "Login successful", "redirectTo": "/citizen", "role": "citizen" }
```

### Profile

| Method | Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/profile` | Returns account info, profile fields, and a computed `completeness` percentage |
| PUT | `/api/profile` | Updates editable profile fields (name, gender, DOB, address, zone/ward, Aadhaar). Login email/role are never editable here. |
| POST | `/api/profile/mobile-otp/request` | `{ mobileNumber }` — starts re-verification of a new mobile number |
| POST | `/api/profile/mobile-otp/verify` | `{ mobileNumber, otp }` — verifies + saves the new number |
| POST | `/api/profile/change-password` | `{ currentPassword, newPassword, confirmPassword }` |
| POST | `/api/profile/photo` | `multipart/form-data`, field `photo` (jpg/png, ≤2MB) |

### Email verification

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/verify-email` | Confirm a registration code (consumes it atomically) |
| POST | `/api/auth/verify-email/resend` | Issue a new code, subject to the 60s cooldown |

### Reference data (used by both the profile and complaint forms)

| Method | Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/departments` | All 16 departments |
| GET | `/api/complaint-types` | All complaint types, grouped by department |
| GET | `/api/locations/zones` | All 15 zones with ward ranges |
| GET | `/api/locations/localities?zoneId=9` | Localities in a zone |
| GET | `/api/locations/streets?localityId=17` | Streets in a locality |

### Complaints

| Method | Endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/complaints/otp/request` | `{ mobileNumber }` — the OTP gate on the file-complaint form |
| POST | `/api/complaints/otp/verify` | `{ mobileNumber, otp }` |
| POST | `/api/complaints/media` | `multipart/form-data`, field `media` (jpg/png/mp4, ≤10MB) — returns `mediaPath` to include in the submit call |
| POST | `/api/complaints` | Submits the complaint (see body shape below) |
| GET | `/api/complaints?code=&status=` | Lists the **logged-in citizen's own** complaints, optionally filtered |
| GET | `/api/complaints/:code` | Full detail + status history for one complaint (ownership-checked) |

**Example — submit a complaint**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/complaints \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --cookie "dcd_session=<your session cookie>" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Ravi", "gender": "Male",
    "streetAddress": "12 Main Road", "pincode": "600018",
    "mobileNumber": "9876543210",
    "zoneId": 9, "wardNumber": 100, "localityId": 14, "streetId": 60,
    "specificLocation": "Near bus stop",
    "latitude": 13.0569, "longitude": 80.2425,
    "complaintTypeId": 1,
    "title": "Street light not working",
    "description": "The street light near the bus stop has been off for a week.",
    "isAnonymous": false
  }'
```
```json
{
  "message": "Your complaint has been registered in the Public Grievance Redressal Portal of GCC. You can check the current status of your complaint using your Complaint Number.",
  "complaintCode": "2026-618SGP",
  "department": "Electrical Department",
  "complaintType": "Street Light Not Functioning"
}
```

## 7. Map Provider

`src/components/MapPicker.tsx` supports two providers behind one contract and
chooses at runtime:

| | With `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| Map, click-to-place, drag pin | Google Maps | Leaflet + OpenStreetMap |
| Address search / autocomplete | yes | no |
| Reverse geocoding (address fill) | yes | no — citizen types the address |
| "Use my location" | yes | yes |
| Ward + serviceability check | yes | yes (uses this app's own polygons) |

When no key is set, the form says so rather than silently offering less.

Google Maps needs the **Maps JavaScript API**, **Places API** and **Geocoding
API** enabled, plus an active billing account. The monthly free allowance is
real but limited and Google has changed its shape — check
<https://mapsplatform.google.com/pricing/> before deploying, and do not assume
it is free. Budget alerts only notify; to actually cap spend, set per-API quota
limits under *APIs & Services → Quotas*. Restrict the browser key by HTTP
referrer and to those three APIs. If you later add server-side Google calls,
use a separate IP-restricted key in a non-`NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable.

### Design notes

* The **pin is the complaint location**. A reverse-geocode result contributes
  address text only, never coordinates — geocoders answer with the centre of a
  road or postcode, which would move the complaint off the marked spot.
* Every async lookup carries the sequence number of the selection that started
  it; a stale response is discarded, so a slow reply for an old pin cannot
  overwrite a newer one.
* Geocoding runs on `dragend` / click / search commit, never on intermediate
  positions while the marker is moving.
* Map autofill only ever touches the **complaint location** fields. The
  complainant's own address and PIN code are never overwritten from the map,
  and are no longer prefilled into the location step from their profile.

## 8. Reference data and its provenance

All reference data is imported by script, stored in `data/`, and recorded in the
`reference_data_sources` table with its source URL and fetch date. Nothing in
this section is hand-authored.

### Complaint types — verified

`node scripts/import-gcc-reference.js` reads the category and subcomplaint
`<select>` elements from the GCC grievance portal:

> <https://erp.chennaicorporation.gov.in/pgr/citizen/BeforeReg.do>

Imported: **17 categories, 327 subcomplaints, 5 "frequently filed" entries**,
preserving GCC's own grouping, wording and ordering. `scripts/seed-gcc-reference.js`
loads them into `complaint_categories` / `complaint_subtypes`, keyed on GCC's
own stable option ids.

**Department routing is only partly known.** GCC does not publish its internal
routing on the citizen page, so the seeder maps only the 8 categories with an
unambiguous counterpart in this app's `departments` table. The remaining 9
(Public Toilet, Voter ID, General, Road and Footpath, Air Quality, Flood, and
the three MEGA STREETS phases — **239 of 327 subcomplaints**) are stored with
`mapping_status = 'unmapped'` and `department_id = NULL`. Complaints of those
types are routed to the fallback department **and flagged
`needs_manual_review`**, and both the form and the confirmation screen tell the
citizen an officer will route it. Add verified routings to
`CATEGORY_DEPARTMENT` in `scripts/seed-gcc-reference.js` and re-run the seeder.

### Areas, localities, streets — verified

The same script walks GCC's own `loadComboAjax.jsp` boundary endpoint:
**250 areas → 4,883 localities → 53,800 streets**. These replace the previous
placeholder tables (32 localities with exactly 6 streets each), which are kept
so existing complaints still resolve.

A citizen can always choose **"Enter street manually"** and supply a street name
plus an optional street type; the two are stored separately in
`manual_street_name` and `street_type`.

### Wards — from boundary polygons, NOT an official GCC feed

`node scripts/import-ward-boundaries.js` downloads GCC ward polygons and writes
`data/boundaries/gcc-wards.geojson` plus a `.meta.json` recording provenance.

* Default source: the **DataMeet** `Municipal_Spatial_Data` community dataset.
  All 200 wards and 15 zones are present, but **it is not an official Greater
  Chennai Corporation publication** and carries no accuracy guarantee. The app
  says so wherever a ward is shown as map-derived.
* GCC's own ArcGIS server (`gis.chennaicorporation.gov.in`) was **not** used:
  its TLS certificate had expired at import time, and fetching it would have
  meant disabling certificate verification. To swap in an official layer:
  `node scripts/import-ward-boundaries.js --source ./official-wards.geojson`.
* Ward is resolved **by point-in-polygon** on the pin coordinates. It is never
  derived from a PIN code, the nearest ward centroid, or geocoded address text —
  all of which produce confident-looking wrong answers near a ward edge.
* The union of the 200 polygons **is** the municipal boundary, so the same test
  answers service eligibility. A rectangular map viewport is never used for this.
* If the boundary file is missing, `/api/locations/resolve-ward` returns
  `unavailable` and the form asks the citizen to pick the ward instead of
  guessing.

**This import corrected existing data.** The `zones` table shipped with ward
ranges that disagreed with the boundary polygons for **124 of 200 wards** (it
placed T. Nagar in Teynampet rather than Kodambakkam, and so on). `zone_wards`
now holds the authoritative per-ward mapping and `zones.ward_start/ward_end` are
refreshed from it. Note that Adyar (170–182) and Perungudi (168–191) have
**overlapping ward spans** in the source data, which a plain start/end range
cannot represent — validation therefore uses `zone_wards`, and the discrepancy
is recorded in `data/boundaries/gcc-wards.meta.json`.

### Area → ward mapping — DERIVED, not authoritative

The ward dropdown narrows to the wards of the selected area. GCC publishes no
such mapping, so `scripts/derive-area-wards.js` approximates one:

1. each GCC area name is geocoded against OpenStreetMap (Nominatim);
2. every ward polygon intersecting the returned bounding box becomes a
   candidate, and the ward containing the point is marked primary.

```bash
node scripts/derive-area-wards.js
```

Rows land in `area_wards` with `confidence = 'derived'`. This cuts a 200-item
dropdown to roughly a dozen and is explicitly **not** good enough to decide
which ward a complaint belongs to:

* the form labels the list as approximate and says it is estimated from map
  data, not published by the Corporation;
* areas that fail to geocode fall back to the full 200-ward list;
* a ward resolved by point-in-polygon from a real map pin always overrides it,
  and the submit endpoint re-checks the pin server-side.

`locality_wards` from migration 004 remains and is still empty; the form now
asks for area + street rather than area + locality + street, so `area_wards` is
the table in use.

## 9. Accounts and sign-in

Registration creates an account that can sign in immediately. There is no email
verification step.

Accounts created this way are stored with `email_verified_at = NULL` and
`email_verification_exempt = 1`: the address was never confirmed, and the flag
records why the account is nonetheless allowed to sign in. Those two columns and
the `email_verify` OTP purpose remain in the schema so verification can be
switched back on without a migration — see the git history for the previous
implementation.

OTP flows are still used for **password reset** and **mobile number
verification**, which is why `src/lib/otp.ts` and the SMTP settings remain.

## 10. Deployment

The app needs a Node server, MySQL, and a persistent disk for uploads.
See **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)** for step-by-step Railway instructions.

Connection settings accept either `DATABASE_URL` / `MYSQL_URL` or the discrete
`DB_*` variables, so the same build runs locally and against a managed database.

```bash
# Point at a fresh managed database and load everything
DATABASE_URL='mysql://user:pass@host:port/dbname' npm run db:setup
```

`db:setup` = `bootstrap-db.js` (loads schema.sql; refuses if tables already
exist) → `migrate.js` → `seed-gcc-reference.js`. For an existing database, run
`npm run migrate` instead.

## 11. What's Next

The `department_officer` (`/officer`) and `collector` (`/collector`)
dashboards are currently placeholder pages, gated by the same
role-based middleware as everything else. Building them out (complaint
review/approval queues, status updates, collector verification) reuses
the same `complaints` / `complaint_status_history` tables and the
`ComplaintStatus` enum already defined in `src/types/index.ts` — no
schema changes needed.
